‚öîÔ∏è I am following Katie Nickels A Cyber Threat Intelligence Self-Study Plan: Part 1 and A Top 10 Reading List if You‚Äôre Getting Started in Cyber Threat Intelligence. I'm also following Scott J Roberts CTI Reading List. My plan is to do bug bounty hunting in the morning and then read CTI material in the evening.

**Week One - Four (May 2023)**
1. Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg 
Progress update: have been sick so reading this instead. 
Note: analogy robber going from house to house trying to open the front door, sometimes tries a window

**1 June 2023**
Back from a road trip. Was talking to my co-driver about The Cuckoo's Egg - about the above analogy

**6 June 2023**
Finished Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg. So not high tech abilities. Just persistence. Trying different ways to log on using a small range of passwords. Like 'admin', 'admin'. Last week I read a pen test report Volkis released. There was a list of passwords that the client's team members were using which included 'Welcome1' and variations of 'pa$$w0rd'. eek. 1989 vs 2023.

Reading Mandiant's CTI Analyst Core Competencies Framework

| CTI Analyst | Core Competencies Pillars|
| --- | --- |
| Problem Solving | critical thinking, research and analysis, investigative mindset |
| Professional Effectiveness |communication, teamwork and emotional intelligence, business acumen |
| Technical Literacy | enterprise IT networks, cyber security ecosystem, roles and responsibilities |
| Cyber Threat Proficiency | drivers of offensive operations, threat concepts and frameworks, threat actors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) |

Had a look at Cosive's Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Crash Course

Watched Cyber Threat Intelligence Explained and How Install MISP Threat Intelligence Platform with Docker, John Hubbard - referred to in the Cosive blog post

| Three Types | Cyber Threat Intelligence | 
| --- | --- |
| Strategic | broad info, relevant groups and goals |
| Operational | short term trends, builds bigger picture from IOCs |
| Tactical | used daily by SOC for detection, IOCs: hashes, IPs, domains etc |

Had a look at MISP. pretty cool open source

Sherman Kent and the Profession of Intelligence Analysis, Occasional Papers: Volume 1, Number 5 

| Sherman Kent‚Äôs analytic doctrine | 9 principles |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Focus on Policymaker Concerns | analysts bring mastery of background knowledge, evaluation and structuring of all-source material, and tradecraft expertise; produce provide ‚Äúactionable‚Äù intelligence |
| 2. Avoidance of a Personal Policy Agenda | identify and evaluate alternatives |
| 3. Intellectual Rigor | information is rigorously evaluated for validity. evaluated and organized data |
| 4. Conscious Effort to Avoid Analytic Biases | resist the tendency to see what they expect to see in the information. make working assumptions explicit and to challenge them vigorously |
| 5. Willingness to Consider Other Judgments | assemble 20 or 30 analysts with a wide range of factual expertise and p.o.v to review a draft assessment, review para by para |
| 6. Systematic Use of Outside Experts | consider a wide range of outside opinions. News media accounts and general and specialized journals should be reviewed |
| 7. Collective Responsibility for Judgment | permit challenge and refinement of data and judgment. represent and defend the appropriate corporate point of view |
| 8. Effective communication of policy-support information and judgments | shorter is usually better, with key points stated |
| 9. Candid Admission of Mistakes | review performance to search for improved practices as well as to study mistakes |

Intelligence Cycle
six steps: requirements, planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination. The cycle is circular in nature and the movement between the steps is fluid.

Sergio Caltagirone, Industrial Control Threat Intelligence Whitepaper -  fundamental principles of CTI
- threat intel kinda like weather forecasting
- prepare to protect before, during and afters
- "3 question rule": threat, impact, action
- context is üëë
- threat intel = 1. context, 2. action


  Commponents of an effective defense
- detection: identify active threats using threat behaviour analytics
- response: mitigate detected threats through incident response
- prevention: proactively prevent through policy, education and technology


- Threat intel categories
- interested adversaries
- direct impact
- indirect impact
  

- Vulnerability analyis: finding vulns in your systems which an adversary could use

- Measuring Threat Intel Quality
  **CART**
  1. Completeness
  2. Accuracy
  3. Relevance
  4. Timeliness
    
- check out Diamond model
- (ICS) kill chain

Looking at CTI analyst job ads to see what skills, tools are used - e.g. spin up AWS

Watching Mimi talk about how CTI is done at her work

so good

**26 June 2023**
Reading Richards J. Heuer's Psychology of Intelligence Analysis 

**30 June 2023**
Having a look at ATT&CK. It was covered a bit in the incident training I did.

**10 + 11 Jul**
Thinking about a post I saw about the Ethics of hacking back
