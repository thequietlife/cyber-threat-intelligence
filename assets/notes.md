⚔️ I am following Katie Nickels A Cyber Threat Intelligence Self-Study Plan: Part 1 and A Top 10 Reading List if You’re Getting Started in Cyber Threat Intelligence. I'm also following Scott J Roberts CTI Reading List. My plan is to do bug bounty hunting in the morning and then read CTI material in the evening.

Week One - Four (May 2023)
1. Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg 
Progress update: have been sick so reading this instead. 
Note: analogy robber going from house to house trying to open the front door, sometimes tries a window
