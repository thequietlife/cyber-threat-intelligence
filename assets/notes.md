⚔️ I am following Katie Nickels A Cyber Threat Intelligence Self-Study Plan: Part 1 and A Top 10 Reading List if You’re Getting Started in Cyber Threat Intelligence. I'm also following Scott J Roberts CTI Reading List. My plan is to do bug bounty hunting in the morning and then read CTI material in the evening.

Week One - Four (May 2023)
1. Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg 
Progress update: have been sick so reading this instead. 
Note: analogy robber going from house to house trying to open the front door, sometimes tries a window

Back from a road trip. Was talking to my co-driver about The Cuckoo's Egg

6 June 2023
Finished Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg. So not high tech abilities. Just persistence. Trying different ways to log on using a small range of passwords. Like 'admin', 'admin'. Last week I read a pen test report Volkis released. There was a list of passwords that the client's team members were using which included 'Welcome1' and variations of 'pa$$w0rd'. eek. 1989 vs 2023.

Had a look at Cosive's Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Crash Course

Strategic - broad info, relevant groups and goals
Operational - short term trends, builds bigger picture from IOCs
