Starting is hard, for me sticking with something is even harder. There is so much information out there about bug bounty hunting. It can be overwhelming. I am following Bugcrowd's Bug Bounty 101 run by InsiderPhD. And committing to putting in time everyday. 

Day 1 homework - learning about computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, loops, pattern generalization, algorithmn design)

Day 2 homework - what is the internet? bit sending, internet working protocol, IP addresses (IPv4, IPv6), DNS (look up domain names and get the associated IP)

Day 3 homework - packets, routing & reliability (packets of information, too many to send at once), TCP does an inventory that all packets rec'd), TCP. source: code.org https://youtu.be/mTGSiB4kB18


Day 4 bugcrowd, How does the internet work?
TCP/IP (3-way handshake), Request, Response, DNS, DNS queries, DNS records, HTTP servers, proxies, HTTP Request/Response
status codes, HTTP headers, GET + POST requests, cookies and sessions, code

Day 5
Learning about DNS settings in practice by changing the domain name for the Pilar website, looking at dnschecker.org, HTTP servers, HTTP request/response. Have realised that the HTML I know from building landing pages is helping understand HTTP Requests. From the little code I know I recognise the structure of the HTML doc, the top with all the charset=UTF-8.

Homework install foxyproxy extension. Got Burp already.

Day 6 
Burp Suite
